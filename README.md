# Forecast Models

Under development

The goal of this project is to show the fundamental steps for the construction of a forecast model. Starting with the study of the time series, going through the metrics and validation processes, to the construction of the model and finally making predictions. 

To make the study robust, we will build three different models that progress in complexity, always analysing why we chose the model and their parameters, their strengths and weaknesses, and what are the improvements of one model in relation to another, that is, what aspect the model in question intends to improve in relation to its predecessor.

We will work with a dataset of daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne, Australia (1981-1990) and our main goal will be to perform one-step forecasts (the minimun temperature of the next day).

The project will be developed in 4 steps (and files):

* 1ยบ Time series analysis; 
* 2ยบ Build Exponential Smoothing model; 
* 3ยบ Build ARIMA model; 
* 4ยบ Build Dynamic Harmonic Regression model;
